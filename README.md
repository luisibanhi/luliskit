Hi, this is **Opensource** Project that tries to have all features that some scheduling tools have as free to use.
This project is using **Node.js** with **Typescript** to be more inclusive to almost all developers that know front and backend technologies.
It is not perfect, and I'm trying to achieve all the features. I will be glad to have issues related to the best practices of **NestJS**, which are the framework we are using.
